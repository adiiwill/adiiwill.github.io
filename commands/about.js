I'm a developer who enjoys creating engaging projects like this portfolio. My experience spans various programming languages including C#, Java, and Python. Recently, I've been exploring component-based frameworks and diving into API backend development.
While web development is a key focus, I'm versatile and always eager to learn new technologies. I'm not a seasoned professional yet, but I'm dedicated to growing my skills every day.
Outside of coding, I'm passionate about hiking, creative writing, and exploring the outdoors. I believe in pushing myself to try new things and continuously improve.
I'm open to new opportunities, particularly in backend development as I look to advance my career. Feel free to check out my skills using the <span style="color: var(--cmdcolor)">[skills]</span> command, or reach out via the <span style="color: var(--cmdcolor)">[contact]</span> command. I'm excited about the possibility of collaborating on innovative projects!</pre>
