  I'm a developer who makes fun projects like this one. <span style="color: var(--highlight)">Web development</span> is not the only thing I do, but I adore <span style="color: var(--highlight)">JavaScript</span> because I feel more capable and efficient within it. I'm currently learning component-based frameworks like <span style="color: var(--highlight)">React</span> and <span style="color: var(--highlight)">Svelte</span>. I've also had experience doing <span style="color: var(--highlight)">API</span> backend stuff, so I'm familiar with most of the concepts. I'm not a professional, but I aspire to be one one day.
  
  I'm also <span style="color: var(--highlight)">familiar with .NET and OOP</span> programming languages like <span style="color: var(--highlight)">C# or Java and Python</span>. I'm open to new things and love to do something that I haven't done before. I love working out, and being active. I write as a hobby and when I have some free time, I try to spend it outdoors. I love hiking and being in the mountains. My goal is to become a better me every day, and to make the most out of my ideas.
  
  Feel free to contact me. I'm open to do backend jobs as a career starter! You can check my experience with the <span style="color: var(--cmdcolor)">[skills]</span> command. Type <span style="color: var(--cmdcolor)">[contact]</span> to see my socials.</pre>
