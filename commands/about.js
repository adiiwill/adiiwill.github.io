  I'm a developer who does fun projects like this one. <span style="color: var(--highlight)">Web development</span> is not the only thing I do, but I adore <span style="color: var(--highlight)">JS</span> because It gives me more freedom and I'm more comfortable with it. I'm currently learning component based frameworks like <span style="color: var(--highlight)">React</span> and <span style="color: var(--highlight)">Svelte</span>. I also had experience making <span style="color: var(--highlight)">REST API</span> interfaces, so i'm familiar with most of it's concepts. I'm not a professional, but I strive to be one one day.
  
  I'm also <span style="color: var(--highlight)">comfortable with .NET and OOP</span> programming languages. I'm open to new things and love doing new stuff every now and then. I love working out, and finding new relationships. I write books as a hobby and when I have some spare time, I try to spend it outside. I love hiking and being in the mountains. One day I want to explore the world with my friends and family! :D
  
  Feel free to contact me. I'm open to do backend jobs as a career starter! You can check my experience with the <span style="color: var(--cmdcolor)">[skills]</span> command. Type <span style="color: var(--cmdcolor)">[contact]</span> to see my socials.</pre>
